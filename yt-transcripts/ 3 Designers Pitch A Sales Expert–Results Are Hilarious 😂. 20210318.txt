could some people come up and pitch you
something that they're like a creative
service and we can hear how they
sell you something sure page 52
a sales person is a facilitator of next
steps selling has nothing to do with
persuading
has nothing to do with persuading it's
not our job
to talk people into things selling is
about determining
a fit between the buyers needs and the
seller's
supply blair runs a consultancy
he's he's an author and he might need
help with social media or
to content creation or marketing or
design
sell us one of those things so that
there's an actual
maybe there's a slim chance you you'll
sell blair something who knows
kavish i'd like to introduce you to
blair ends
what do you got to sell hi okay so hi
blair uh
i wonder uh you are writing a new book
right so
could you tell me the name of this new
book it's possible i
cannot tell you it's a matter of uh
personal policy that i don't talk about
whatever book i'm writing
so blair um i actually run a marketing
agency it's called welbeck media
and i was wondering if you want to hire
us for
marketing a book yeah i really
appreciate you reaching out and asking
no i don't you don't need that
no um all right i would just
like to ask you uh how was how was your
sales
with the previous book um were you
satisfied with it
yes very satisfied you were extremely
satisfied
yes so you touched millions and millions
of lives
but we have a way in which you can touch
even more lives
and not in a very hard sell approach but
just with
a few optimized ads and a few creative
ads
so would you be interested in reaching
out to more
millions and millions of people with
your influence
well i already work with an entire ads
team
as part of my marketing team so i would
just refer you to them
okay that wasn't that was a respectable
attempt uh wha what could kavish do
better
well the fundamental problem is that you
know
we're setting up a situation where you
have something to sell and you're trying
to
sell to me without going deep but now
you did you did probably the best you
could of kavish in
in that you picked up on something that
that has already come up so you've got a
piece of information that says
i've got a book coming out and you
thought okay i can help with that
so instead of just pitching me something
whether you so
whether you knew i had a possible need
for it or not you identified a
an area of need and you asked me about
it so i think you did as well as you
could have
anybody could have expected you to do in
that situation
but the reality is if i don't see that i
have a problem
[Music]
then there's nothing there's very little
you as a salesperson can do
if i don't think that i have a problem
it's the same as me not having a problem
if there's nothing that you can help me
with from my point of view
it doesn't really matter what your point
of view is now you can see of
an obvious problem maybe i tell you the
name of my ads team and you go
oh i know i know those guys they do
horrible work and maybe you wouldn't say
that to me but
it's just reinforcement to you that that
you think
you can help me with something but i'd
like to break it down
a little bit more yeah here's what i saw
so your first about the problem was to
tell him what you think his problem is
without even having real dialogue with
him
that would be mistake number one mistake
number two that i saw was
in your panic and it's natural that
you're panicking at that moment you
start talking about yourself
and that's when my interest meter went
from four
to like one i need to feel that you're
concerned about what it is that i'm
concerned about and you haven't done
enough there but you did exactly what we
would hope you do
which is get up here and pitch hard and
for that you win our respect
let's try it one more time with the next
person
i notice the website is good and it's
really well built out
but i also had a look at your instagram
page and
i'm realizing that
your posts aren't as
well aren't really frequent i was
wondering if
you've considered using instagram as
a funnel in terms of getting clients to
your website
they're probably underperforming on the
organic part of those platforms
so go on
so my offering is
to you i know it can be difficult for
entrepreneurs to have their hand in
every basket
and manage it to the best of their
ability
so i'm offering to create
organic content that will drive
sales generation or drive leads to your
website
for your instagram page what do you
think about that
i think as i have somebody else on my
team
who manages marketing and manages our
marketing team
um that's not my call to make but i
would be willing to introduce you to
them
and basically if
they like what they hear from you it's
really
i'm not going to tell them one way or
another i'll just say i had this
conversation with this guy i'd like you
to listen to them
don't read anything into it if you
think there's some value there go ahead
and do whatever you think is appropriate
i'm willing to make that introduction
thank you thank you very well done all
right
round of applause for kadeem
all right all right well done okay blair
critique and analysis please i think
under the circumstances you know given
the platform that he has to do this in i
was super impressed
and at some point it was i mean we both
knew he had something to sell
i'm always open to you know being an
entrepreneur i'm always interested in
talking to people who have bright ideas
about things but then
i'm also learning to be a good manager
and i don't
micromanage my marketing team they know
a lot more about this sort of stuff than
i do
and they i know they have prior
marketing priorities for the year
including marketing a book
if it ever comes out very nice
very well done you can sleep well
tonight my friend sleep well that you
got a very positive review from blair
okay so i have a question for you blair
is there anything
that you're doing that you could use
some
external expertise that you don't have
in-house
i'm just wondering if there's something
you think about that you think we could
be doing better
you know as an entrepreneur things that
keep you up at night like you know we're
not performing well there i'm not sure
what i refer to internally as quality
cues
the overall quality of stuff that is
designed
that isn't marketing even documents
like the rote the normal in fact i've
been looking for somebody in
it's really hard to find a document
designer these days it used to be
actually a fairly common skill
so it sounds like boring stuff maybe not
really high value maybe not all that
strategic but maybe somebody would see
an opportunity in it
that's what i would like to have
somebody where it's like hey can you
look at this make that better make that
better make that better and it's um
it's usually not the stuff that touches
marketing because there's a dedicated
team's all the internal stuff the
stuff on the lms some elements of the
training materials
etc i'm also interested
in a designer for the next book the next
book is going to be more highly designed
so i'm interested in that too so it
sounds to me like you're looking for
somebody who can help
improve the internal aesthetic of the
documents that are
not public facing yet yep
okay and would that have any material
impact in your business if that were
improved or is that just a personal
thing like it's a matter of pride
no i think you know it's an element of
the brand that
um you know you get in somewhere you
start paying money and you notice
especially when your audience is
designers creatives you notice yeah
that's a little bit pedestrian
um that could be designed to higher
quality
so i would say like all printed
materials and some of the
web-based stuff that's on the lms our
marketing team doesn't touch the lms
we basically use something out of the
can
okay so you had mentioned something like
it didn't feel like it was
up to the standard in which you have set
for the win without pitching brand right
yeah and you said like it's it's kind of
pedestrian like maybe
people don't get excited about it but if
somebody was really excited about it and
took
a look at all these documents and really
took ownership of that and just really
brought it to that standard that you
talked about
is that even worth any money to you to
do yeah so
presentation design as well it's been
years since i had somebody do
presentations for talks um
i'd love some standards around that yeah
we're getting somewhere now are we
getting something i know it doesn't
sound
super meaty but then you know here's the
other thing
it's the hardest thing for me to hire a
designer right because what happens is
they try to make me eat my own dog food
they read my material and then they come
back with these crazy proposals with the
high prices trying
keenly aware of the fact that they need
to sell to me a certain way and it just
creates a whole lot of awkwardness
so it's the hardest thing for me to hire
a designer and so again there are
designers on the marketing team
but i leave them alone i don't use them
for non-marketing stuff
um and i would love to have somebody
that's like hey can you do this can you
do so there's probably a lot of
little work and if somebody had some
initiative around more strategic stuff
i'm open to
like ideas about what else we can do to
make stuff better so
there's an opportunity there you know
i'm holding your book in my hand here
and i i know you've talked about this
before but you wanted to write the win
without pitching manifesto
something that could withstand the test
of time and everything from the paper
stock to the type faces
that you're using here has that kind of
timelessness to it
and the way it's bound with this hot
foil stamping this red and black
super cool and then i see some of the
presentations i've seen some of your
presentations
and there does seem to be a little gap
it's not to be critical but if it could
live up to the standard and all the
other documents
yeah and maybe even go beyond this i
mean somebody
we we know designers who could do that
is that something you would
spend money against i mean oh absolutely
yeah i love the direction this this room
is going in
we're going to solve my problems all
right
yeah yeah yeah okay all right let's take
a time out
take a timeout regal smiling let's take
a timeout chris is going to sell me
something
yeah i was just selling you something
and i just wanted to ask
people did you see a little difference
there between me trying to sell
i didn't even know i was being sold that
was so good
i was like i wonder when blair is gonna
realize something is happening here
no i was like going deeper and deeper
yeah you know somebody that could
what i yeah and i'm i'm totalling up the
tens of thousands of dollars that i'm
willing to spend no i would
i no i would pay more i'd pay more no
who is this person
i'd like to bring on some people and ask
them what did you just witness here
while blair is figuring out i just tried
to celebrate something
you know my business coach told me one
time he says sales people are the
easiest people to sell to
marketers are the easiest people to
market to because they
they want to believe in this future
state
they believe in change management and so
once you just hit upon something
they're ready to go so i was i wasn't
sure half of like i wonder blair's just
playing along with me here
i thought you were serious i mean it was
like really you know yeah i mean i am
serious but i'm not serious i'm serious
for the role play oh god
i knew i was sleeping right in right if
i don't get a new designer out of this
conversation
i went in saying yeah i don't need
anything and now like in 30 seconds 60
seconds you had me like yeah no who is
it i'll hire them yes
i would like to get your take joshua
austin or chris
on one thing that you saw that was a
little bit different in my approach to
blair
than the other two gentlemen who had
pitched prior the reason why i didn't
recognize it at first
was because it started like a very
ordinary conversation
and it was i actually thought you guys
were just talking our director of
coaching
shannon lee i heard her say this to a
group once she said um
all very good conversationalists right
if you're an adult
you're a good conversation you have and
maybe there are small number of
exceptions to that but let's just assume
everybody in this room
we're all really good communicators
we're good at understanding people we're
good at listening we're
good at expressing our points the moment
the conversation
is about sales we somehow lose our [ __ ]
and we feel all of this pressure to say
exactly the right thing
to be the slick polished person and i
often say if i could do one thing for
for you it would be this have you
unlearn
all of the baggage you think should be
associated with a sales conversation
it's the same
as talking to a parent a child a peer
a mentor everything if you know any
homeschooled kids what's in what's
really strikes you about homeschooled
kids
they don't they talk to everybody the
same way
they treat everybody they talk to an
adult the same way they talk to a child
doesn't matter who you are they talk
they're the same
genuine person and their personality
doesn't change because they don't think
oh this is an older person
and that's what an effective salesperson
does
and that's what you just did really well
is you just had the normal conversation
there was nothing about your demeanor
or even your approach that changed or
felt unnatural
chris what you did so well naturally and
what i witnessed in all of your role
play videos
is your conversations with
people like us your students is the same
way that you go about selling it's just
genuinely caring about
what's what's happening um you know
another person's
brain and what they're thinking about
about and so that and that's what i
noticed you write in the book to sell
there's three components help the
unaware inspire the interested
and then reassure those who have formed
intent here's the key takeaway from this
conversation
it's a little counter-intuitive but to
be a more effective salesperson
ask more questions not just any question
ask questions that get the prospect to
tell you about a problem
or challenge they're currently
experiencing another way of saying this
statements tell questions sell
sell through curiosity learn to be more
inquisitive
and whatever you do don't make
assumptions don't pitch
don't convince otherwise you'll come
across as not caring
or only caring about yourself people buy
for their own reasons and often
not for the reasons you think so keep a
tone that's conversational
your goal is to be a great listener seek
first to understand if you're telling
you're not selling i know it might sound
easy to do but it's not
it takes confidence patience and
practice to get good at this
keep applying these principles until
they become second nature to you
