LinkedIn Sales Navigator is the most
used tool by sales reps. The problem,
most people don't know how to use it,
right? They stick to basic filters
instead of using advanced plays that
actually get results. In this video, I'd
like to get technical. I'll show you 12
ways to find leads with strong triggers
and the exact messages you can send
them. But before we dive in, let me show
you how to define personas. Personas are
just saved filters. For example, all
heads of growth at companies with 50 to
200 employees in the software industry.
You'll see why this matters in a bit.
All right. Let's go. Play number one.
Recent job changes. When someone just
landed a new role, they're more open to
fresh ideas and solutions. They often
have budgets, pressure to perform, and
authority to make changes. Reaching out
now gives you the best shot at starting
a new partnership. To do this, select a
persona, then click on the changed jobs
toggle. Here's the message you can send.
By the way, throughout all of these
plays, if you want to take the time to
read them, just pause. Play number two,
make a list of prospects you talk to.
Check if they have changed company
recently or changed job. Your lost deals
aren't dead. They just moved. When a
prospect changed jobs, they might need
your product again. This time with more
influence or urgency. Reaching out now
feels warm, not cold. To do this, make a
list with all the prospects you're
talking with. Then from time to time,
select this lead list and check the jobs
change toggle. Here's a message that
works. Day number three, promotions
internally. If a prospect's still at the
same company but shows a recent job
change, they've likely been promoted.
That means new goals, bigger budgets,
and fresh pain points. Filter for people
with more than one year at the company
who recently changed jobs. Here's a good
message to send that speaks to the pain
they're likely facing in the new role.
Play number four, alumni of your school.
Alumni trust alumni. It's an easy way to
break the ice. Shared experience builds
instant credibility and makes your
outreach feel personal, not random. Head
to the personal section. Click on school
and enter yours. Here's the beginning of
the message you can send them next to
the company growth triggers. This
signals that the company is scaling and
likely investing. This brings us to play
number five, headcount growth. When a
company is hiring fast, it means growth
and growing pains. That's your chance to
offer a solution before they start
feeling the stretch. It works even
better when it's a specific department.
Now, you can't filter that from the lead
section, but no worries, it's easy. Go
to the accounts tab and use the
department headcount growth filter. I
usually go with at least 33%. Then save
those companies to a list and head back
to the leads tab. Apply your persona
filter again and ta here's a message for
sales and business development teams
growing fast. Let's move on to social
and behavioral intent. These are signals
that the person is showing interest or
activity on LinkedIn. So plane number
six, they viewed your LinkedIn profile
recently. If they checked your profile,
they're already curious. It's a perfect
warm signal. Reach out whilst it's still
fresh in their mind. This is especially
relevant if you're posting content
related to what you sell. In the buyer
intent section, click on viewed your
profile recently. Filter with your
personas and send something like,
"All right, lane number seven, company
followers or company competitors."
People who follow your company or your
competitors are already in the market.
They know the space, so your message
won't come out of nowhere. It's the
other filter in the buying intent, the
following your company one. What I
usually like to do is ask for feedback
on new content we just published to
build on their initial interest. this
one. Let me read you the example email.
Hey, first name. Saw you follow Lemlist
on LinkedIn. Thanks for that. Wanted to
share the first version of our new cold
calling playbook. Would love your
feedback. Looks like cold calling might
be part of your motion at company. If
they follow a competitor, it's more of a
hack. You need to add the company in
your own experience. Then apply the
filter. So the message would look like
this. Notice the call to action here.
Write it down. Play number eight. Post
of targeted leads. Let's leave the lead
section for a while and go to the home
one. In the alert tab, you will see all
the recent posts published by people in
your list. If you see someone is talking
about something you can solve, shoot the
message. It's a quick win. Something
like this works. Notice here that we
mentioned the posts and the exact line
that stood out to show it's not
something automated. Now, we should take
a moment to talk about affinity and
relationship signals. These are warm
paths you can use to build credibility
with play number nine. Connection of
through referrals. Mutual connections
build instant trust. Use the connection
of filter to find warm paths. Then ask
for an intro or mention the shared link
in your message. Don't reach out to
people you connected with but never
spoke to. What I like to do instead is
whenever I close a new customer. I use
the connections of to see who they've
connected with that could be a fit. Then
I send the following message to my
customer. Also think about your past
colleagues. They may have worked in
companies that are interesting to you.
Something like this would work. Keep it
casual. It's time for strategic
relevance with play number 10. Past
companies hot leads. These are people
who used to work at your customer
companies. They know you. They know what
you offer. And now that they've moved,
they're more likely to bring your
solution into their new company. I'd
send a short message like this. Play
number 11. Competitors of your
customers. If one of your customers is
using your product, chances are their
competitors are feeling a pressure that
makes them more open to hearing how
you're helping their rival. Use that
momentum to start a relevant, timely
conversation. Hey Brian, noticed you're
in a similar space to Georgees. They
came to Lemness after seeing weak
results from single channel outreach. We
help them add LinkedIn into the mix and
they triple their results. Want to see
what that could look like for you? Hey,
number 12, company news and alerts. I'm
not going to lie, I don't really use
this one every day since it's more for
big accounts, but if you go into the
accounts tab and select a list, you'll
get some insights on these companies.
Here's an example and the kind of
message you can send. Before I let you
go, I want to point out that Sales
Navigator is great for fresh data, but
there are three drawbacks. Firstly, if
you want to reach out at scale, you need
a sales engagement platform. It's
inevitable. Number two, the number of
intent signals is limited. And lastly,
it's expensive. That's why Lemlist, we
don't use sales navigator. We use
Lemlist directly. It gives you access to
450 million contacts and smart filters
like company texts, last funding date,
revenue, or even keywords in the company
description. You can also see which
companies visited your website. Nice. So
basically everything I just showed you
can be done inside Lemlist. You're
welcome. The difference, you don't need
a sales enough subscription. And when
you find leads with strong intent, you
can enrich and push them into a multi-
channelannel campaign with one click.
It's a game changer. And if you want to

That was Rafa from Lemlist. Cheers.
