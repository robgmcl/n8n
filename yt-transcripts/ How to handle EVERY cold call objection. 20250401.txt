Uh, sorry, I'm not interested. We
already have a solution. Uh, it's too
expensive.
[Music]
Our sales team has booked thousands of
meetings through cold calling. This is
by far the least crowded channel you
should be leveraging if you haven't
already. But every time it's the same
process. You grab their attention, you
pitch, and then come the objections.
Think about it. When you're calling them
out of the blue, they're on guard and
need time to process. That's why in 90%
of cases, they raise objections. Spoiler
alert, it's always the same nine
objections over and over again. So, in
this video, we're breaking down each
one, what they really mean, and most
importantly, how to handle them. We did
the work for you, so next time you face
these objections, you'll know exactly
what to say and never miss an
opportunity to book a meeting. We've
collected nine real calls from the 1,000
plus our team made in the last 3 months,
all featuring these same objections.
Let's dive into the first one. I'm not
interested. Let's be real. When someone
says this, it's usually not about your
offer. It's just a knee-jerk reaction to
a cold call they weren't expecting. So,
instead of pushing back, let's start
with empathy. Done. I totally get it,
man. You probably get tons of these
calls, and I'm guessing you've got most
of this handled already. This lowers
their guard. You're not fighting them.
You're agreeing. Now, if you want to
make it fun, try flipping the script.
Oh, man. I guess I'm reading the room
here, right? Let me know if I'm not.
Sounds like I just came across the
griiest person alive. Can I have a
second chance? This makes them laugh and
keeps the conversation going. But if you
want to get to the root of their
objection, the best thing is to use a
pattern interrupt. Hey, just so nobody
from my team bugs you again, is it that
you already know what we do and it's
just not a priority right now, or did I
just catch it the worst possible time
and you're not a fan of cold calls? This
forces them to think and give you a real
answer. Now, instead of just shutting
you down, they're engaging and that's
your opening. Objection number two, can
you give me some information? Just email
me. There's a bunch of reasons why
someone might say, "Just send me an
email." Maybe they hate phone calls.
Maybe they're busy and just can't talk
right now. Or maybe they're brushing you
off and won't read a word you say. Here
are three ways to handle this objection.
Approach number one, agree with a twist.
Yeah, totally. I'd be happy about that.
I'll put something together for you
later today. Is there any specific info
you would be happy to know? Now, you're
back in control of the conversation. It
keeps them engaged and gives you
insights into their needs. Either you
spot a real need and get to a call, or
you send such a tailored email they'd
feel silly not to reply. Approach number
two, make it low risk. All right, I'll
send the email, but I'll also drop a
quick 5-minute placeholder for the same
time tomorrow. If you've got questions,
we can run through them. If not, just
decline the invite. No hard feelings,
promise. This lowers the bar, makes it
easy to say yes, and still moves things
forward. Approach number three, call it
out. Can I ask you something, Carl? Are
you actually reading your emails? I know
how busy you are. My email will fall
into a trap. That's why I'd suggest we
just take 15 minutes and I'll walk you
through how it works. If it's not your
thing, I'll leave you in peace forever.
This one's bold, but it feels human. It
works because it's honest. It ain't
much, but it's honest work. Objection
number three, not a priority right now.
When someone says this, they're not
saying no. They're saying they don't see
a reason to change. Your job is to get
them to think differently. So instead of
challenging their choice directly,
challenge their entire process. Get them
to walk you through it. Because once
they do, inefficiencies will surface on
their own. start with just so I don't
miss anything. Can you walk me through
how you currently handle specific
process as they explain? Listen for
trigger keywords you know you can bring
a solution to especially manual work,
inefficiencies or bottlenecks. Then you
zoom in on them. So you're handling that
manually, right? Just to get a sense how
long does it usually take. The moment
they realize it takes way too much time,
they start questioning their own
process. Let's take an example with a
sales engagement platform like List.
Just so I don't miss anything, how do
your reps currently follow up the leads?
Uh they manually send emails, track
responses, and follow up based on who
engages. Ah, so each follow-up is done
manually, right? Uh just out of
curiosity, how much time does it take
per lead? H not sure, maybe 10 minutes
per lead across multiple touches. And
how many new leads are coming in each
week? Around 150. So that's 25 plus
hours a week just sending follow-ups.
Now you get their problem. Then it's
time for you to shine. How? With this
glorious sentence. Eric, mind if I make
a suggestion? Then you do a personalized
pitch for them. Objection number four.
We already have a solution. We use a
competitor. This is one of my favorites.
And to handle it well, focus on a use
case you know they need. Something your
competitors can't do, but you can.
Prepare one question that hits where it
matters. It will itch your prospect so
much he'll be dying to scratch it.
Here's how that sounds. Oh, you're using
Salesoft. Mind if I ask you something?
Your team altogether isn't sending more
than 30 mails a day or anything like
that, right? Of course, we send more,
right? That's exactly why companies like
Mindy and Akalad switched to Lemist. We
support inbox rotation. If your teams
are sending 30 plus emails a day from
the same domain, your domain is getting
burned. You're probably hitting spam
nine times out of 10. If you want better
results from outbound, your emails need
to land in the inbox first. With email
rotation across multiple sending
addresses, you fix that. My guess is
you're probably not ready to switch. But
would you be open to just taking a look
so you know what's out there and maybe
see how you can save your
deliverability. The goal, guide them
towards realizing a gap exists because
once they do, they'll be open to hearing
your solution. Remember, you diagnose a
problem they didn't know they had. Make
them realize the impact of it then and
only then they're receptive. Objection
number five, no budget, it's too
expensive. Well, price objections aren't
always about money. They're about
logistics or priorities. Your job isn't
to help them find more budget, but to
get them to see your solution as
important enough to shift money that
already exists towards it. Start by
understanding if budget is truly locked
or it's just not a priority. Hey Jason,
just so no one from my team bothers you
again, would you mind giving me a sense?
Is budget completely out for this cycle
or is it just that any new spend
requires jumping through a million
hoops? If they confirm there's no
budget, challenge their thinking. Do you
feel like the budget you've been given
is actually enough to solve this
problem? Now, they have to acknowledge
whether their current spend is working.
If they say yes, shift the conversation
to cost versus results. With cost being
the most important thing to your CEO,
how does that compare to actually
getting results and solving this
problem? This reframes the conversation
because saving money means nothing if
they're still stuck with the same
problem. If there's still hesitance,
position your solution as a way to cut
costs elsewhere. Yeah, I'm hearing this
a lot from other sales leaders. That's
exactly why I called. Many teams are
juggling multiple tools for outreach,
CRM, and reporting, which ends up
costing more and slowing reps down. If
you're open to it, I can show you how
we're helping teams consolidate and cut
those costs. And if they're still not
ready, remove the pressure. No worries.
If budget opens up later, would it help
to at least see how this works now so
you already have a plan in place? Here's
the trick. Don't push them to find
budget. Instead, challenge how they're
spending existing budget and whether
it's actually solving their problem. One
more thing, sometimes it's not about the
budget itself, but the logistics of how
they spend it. They might have the money
but can't commit a large amount up
front. This is a fake objection that you
can manage with payment terms. Yeah, no,
I totally get that, Jason. I've seen
this come up before. Not because the
budget doesn't exist, but because it's
already allocated. Uh, quick question.
If there was flexibility on how payments
were structured, would that change
things for you? Don't miss opportunities
because of that. Objection number six, I
need to talk to my boss or I need to
think about it. When someone says this,
they're not necessarily objecting you.
They just need more confidence before
moving forward. Your job is to
understand what's holding them back.
Okay, John, I hear you. I'm guessing you
want to take your time before making an
important decision, right? Let them
agree, then dig deeper. Since you're
already on the phone, I'm curious. What
specifically do you need to think about?
Maybe I can help answer any questions
right now so you have everything you
need to decide. If they need to check
with their boss, offer to make it
easier. That makes total sense. If it
helps, how about we schedule a quick
call with your boss so I can walk them
through the details. That way, I can
answer any questions directly instead of
putting you in the position of having to
explain everything yourself. Would that
make things easier? This removes
friction, keeps the momentum going, and
increases the chances of moving the deal
forward since you bring the decision
maker into your call directly. Objection
number seven. It is not my
responsibility. I don't handle that.
When someone says this, don't end the
conversation. Use it to find the right
person and get a warm intro. Ah,
totally, Mark. That's on me. Honestly,
it's sometimes a 50-50 chance where
something like lead ownership across
outbound campaigns forms. Sometimes it's
under sales ops, sometimes RevOps. Just
so I don't call the wrong person again.
Would this be something Karen handles
since she runs RevOps? If they confirm
it's not their responsibility, don't
just ask for a name. Get permission to
mention them. Yes, got it. I was
planning to reach out to Karen anyway.
Could I ask for a ridiculous favor?
Would you be completely against me
mentioning that we spoke just so she
knows I'm not coming out of the blue?
Now, instead of cold outreach, you have
a warm referral, making your next
conversation much easier. Objection
number eight. I'm too busy and I don't
have time. When someone says they're too
busy, it's usually not about time. It's
about priority. Your job is to make it
easy for them to give you a moment now
or secure a time when they will be
available. If they say, "You caught me
in the middle of a meeting. Keep it
quick." I totally get that. Can I have
30 seconds to tell you why I'm calling?
If it doesn't make sense, I'll let you
go. If they're rushing, secure a real
follow-up. Look, I'm not going anywhere.
I'll call you back, but let's find a
time when you can actually expect my
call. What works for you? If they've
hung up on you before, acknowledge it
and reset the conversation. Hey Kate, we
spoke on the 20th of March around
midday. I think it was. And you were
slammed getting ready for a big meeting.
You even hung up on me. Hey, no worries.
I get it. I called out of the blue, but
I took the time to prepare for this
call. And I promise this isn't just a
random sales pitch. Give me 28 seconds
to tell you why I called back. And if it
doesn't make sense, you can hang up on
me again. And if you've spoken to them
before, reference it to pick up where
you left off. Hey, I spoke to you in
June and back then you mentioned the bad
reply rates on your outreach campaign.
Just curious, where do things stand now?
This keeps the conversation open whilst
respecting their time. Last but not
least, objection number nine. How did
you get my name and number? Easy. Just
say, "Oh, with a Lemnist, of course.
Best phone number provider out there."
Uses Waterfall Enrichment with four
different providers. You should
definitely check it out. Then flip it
back on them. By the way, how does your
team usually find contact info? What to
process? If they mention anything
manual, dig deeper. So, you're doing
that manually, right? How long does that
usually take per contact? You get it?
push it back to them to spot their
problems. And that's it. The nine most
common objections and exactly how to
handle them. Objections aren't
roadblocks. They're just conversations
waiting to happen. Now that you have
those strategies in your back pocket,
careful they don't get stolen. Phrases
like I'm not interested or it's too
expensive are opportunities rather than
dead ends. It's all about perspective.
You've got the tools to keep the
conversation going and land those
meetings. Try these approaches in your
next calls and drop a comment letting us
know if they worked for you. And if
you're wondering how to do cold calling
