Hey Jessica, I recently visited your
Walmart store at Maplewood Plaza and
noticed uh there were no photovalttaic
canopies installed in the parking area.
As you may know, since May 1st, 2025,
the New Jersey climate and resilience
law requires that parking lots over a
certain size, typically more than 80
spaces, be equipped with solar canopies
covering at least 50% of their surface.
Have you already partnered with a
service provider to ensure compliance
and potentially reduce your energy
costs? PS. Here's how Trader Joe's
Austin installed 612 solar panels in
just 5 weeks. This email doesn't feel
like a blast. It feels personal, like
someone actually showed up and noticed
something real, even if it's not true.
It's tied to a regulation that creates
urgency instantly. The question is soft,
not salesy. It opens the door without
pushing. The PS shows subtle proof that
this works. Real results, real company,
clickable curiosity. It earns attention,
builds relevance, and lowers friction.
The best cold email templates in 2025
don't start with a pitch. They start
with relevance, real triggers, real
value, and just enough personal touch to
make your prospects think, "Hm, wait,
this might actually be for me." In this
video, I'll walk you through seven
proven cold email templates. They're
short, they're snappy, and they've
already helped teams like yours book
more meetings without sounding like
every other sales email out there. Each
one comes with a breakdown of why it
works so you can adapt it to your market
and make it your own. Let's get to the
second email here. The subject is
luggage storage. Hi Daniel, just checked
your Palm View in booking page and it
seems the luggage storage is free. Your
hotel might have an untapped gold mine.
Once Seaside Lodge in San Diego
partnered with the luggage plus and
started charging for luggage storage,
they earned an additional $3,000 a
month. Plus, they stopped stressing
about missing bags. We took care of it
for them. Not to mention that the
visibility in the Luggage Plus app
boosted their bookings by 13%. Tourists
who were looking for a place to store
their luggage in San Diego discovered a
new place to stay. Can I share more
information on how you can start doing
the same before the peak season? It
spots a missed opportunity, backs it up
with proof, and shows what someone else
gains concretely. The tone stays
friendly, not pushy. The urgency feels
natural, linked to peak season, not
sales pressure. It works because it
starts with a real observation from a
website that can't be denied by the
recipient. PS, do not fake it. Do the
job. Check it for real or the results
won't follow. Third email. This next one
reflects a growing trend in outbound.
Giving prospects something before asking
for anything. Here's what it looks like
in the outbound sales industry. Hi Mark,
I have direct contact info for 100
qualified decision makers in industry
extraction ready to go. Can I share the
list with you? I saw you're looking to
hire an SDR. Here are three people I
would recommend for that post. Our
platform references the best remote
sales rep for the SDR position. Feel
free to check it out. If you can do it,
you should definitely test it. Think
about it. An SDR would love getting
decision makers. An HR manager would
love to have candidates to reach out to.
A product marketer would love feedback
on their website. Keep it short. Deliver
value first. Once the conversation
starts and they've seen what you can do,
asking for a meeting feels much, much
easier. You know it. I know it fourth
email. Now we're entering warm outreach
territory. The goal? Use past
interactions with the prospect to avoid
reaching out cold. Here's what that
sounds like. Hi Taylor, reaching out
from LinkedIn. I had a few questions
about Bright Path Media. To keep it
short, we help agencies grow their
revenue by over 30% per year using a
client acquisition system we developed.
In practice, we implement the same
methods that helped us reach $2 million
in annual revenue in 3 years. Would love
to chat. Can we connect? This works
because it's a weak reason that sounds
like a good one. Since it's warm, you
can go straight in with a results
focused pitch. Here's the flow. Send a
connection request, then move them into
a multi- channelannel campaign. Just
like that, you double your chances of
getting a reply. Easy. Fifth email.
Let's say you had a webinar or an event
with a lead. I'll show you how to use
the ADA methodology. ADA stands for
attention, interest, desire, and action.
Hi, first name, attention. Thanks again
for joining the webinar. Let me know if
you'd like the recording and I'll send
it over. Interest. I had a look at what
Fin Litics is doing and it's clear why
cold calling is a smart move for you.
Desire. Just last week, I spoke with a
customer in Fintech. They found that
calling prospects right after a LinkedIn
connection got the best results when
targeting VPs of finance and action. I'd
love to exchange ideas for your outreach
strategy. I'm free next Tuesday if you'd
like to chat. This email works for two
reasons. Even if the prospect isn't
ready for a call, they might reply just
to get the assets so you can start
nurturing. It also ties the event
directly to the prospect. You shift from
broad to personal. That small extra
effort can boost your reply rate by 30%.
That's massive. By the way, this didn't
even take much time. Even the
personalized line was generated using AI
variables. I used data from the person's
LinkedIn profile pulled with a Lemnist
extension. Then I created two AI
variables to identify their industry and
the job titles of the prospect they're
most likely to target. Seventh email. To
finish, I want to show you a funny
follow-up that can get you an extra 36%
click-through rate. That's CTR. The
trick is this. Don't include a link in
your first email. It helps for
deliverability. Then send a second
email. Max 24 hours after the first one.
I think it's better if you can do it
within 2 to 3 hours after and in the
same thread. Why would you do this? It
makes it feel like you're on your phone
and forgot to send the link. It happens.
So, you come across like a real person,
not a robot sending automated stuff.
It's smart. It's tricky, but it works.
In this video, I showed you some great
templates that brought solid results for
our customers. But here's the trick.
Don't just copy them. The key here is to
adapt each one for your market, your
problems, and your industry. Test them,
tweak them, and once you find what
works, scale it. Lemn is built just for
that. And remember, even the best email
won't work if you're not reaching out to
the right people. Build a solid list,
find real triggers, then reach out. If
your leads already have the problem you
solve, you've done a third of the work.
