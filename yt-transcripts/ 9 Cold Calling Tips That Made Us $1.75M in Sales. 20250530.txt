Since January 2025, our sales team
closed $1.75 million in deals. And cold
calling played a big part in that, but
not the way most people do it. We've put
together a full playbook that recaps
these tips and goes even further. You'll
find it in the description below. Now,
let's get straight into these nine tips
we use to turn cold calls into book
meetings. First, don't do cold calls.
What? Well, everyone says cold calling
is dead. Truth is, it's not. But the way
most people do it, that's what's dead.
Think about the last time a random
number popped up on your phone. Did you
answer? Probably not. Unsurprising
because even if you did, you were
already annoyed. That's the problem with
cold calls. They interrupt. They're
random and they feel pushy. You get
rejected even before you say your name.
Context matters. But here's the shift.
The best cold calls and cold at all.
They're warm. They happen right after a
trigger. Like when someone downloads
your ebook, joins a webinar, or checks
your pricing page. Or when they start a
free trial, use a key feature, or invite
a teammate. or even when they just open
an email, click a link, or accept your
LinkedIn invite. That's when they know
your name. That's when they're curious.
That's exactly when you call. Again,
context matters. Lemnist, you can set
this up in seconds. Pick a trigger. Say
someone accepts your LinkedIn requests,
add a condition, and ooh, task schedule
to call. When you call, it's not cold.
They say, "Oh yeah, I remember you."
Now, the conversation starts on your
terms. So, don't start with a dial tone.
Start with the trigger. Tip number two,
don't call alone. Got your list, got
your pitch, start calling, and no one
picks up. Why? Well, that's because
calls only work during work hours. Most
people don't answer unknown numbers and
not everyone likes phone calls. Some
prefer LinkedIn. Others check email
after work. If you rely on cold calls,
you miss out most of your chances.
That's why go multi- channel. Use email,
LinkedIn, phone, and even physical mail
if it fits. Why not? Email and LinkedIn
work while you sleep. Calls take more
effort, but when someone picks up, you
get a real conversation. Automate what
you can. Focus your time where it counts
on replies. More touch points, more
replies. That's how that works. Don't
just call. Combine channels and reach
prospects where they are. Third tip, get
valid phone numbers first. You may have
the best lead lists, a killer script.
But there's just one problem. No phone
number or worse, wrong number. Now
you're stuck. You can't reach your lead.
No matter how good your pitch is, it
won't matter if it doesn't get heard.
And if you're working off bad data,
you're not just wasting time, you're
burning money. Time is money. Who knows?
That's why the very first step is this.
Get valid phone numbers. And good news,
this isn't 2010 anymore. In 2025, you've
got tools to make it easy. With
Waterfall Enrichments, you don't rely on
just one provider. You cascade down the
list of data sources until you hit the
right number. Lemn does this
automatically with four different
providers. Results get up to 85% of
phone numbers. Way better than the 40%
you'd get from using just one. Bad data
kills cold calls. Great data opens the
door to real conversations. Number four,
call at specific times. You've probably
heard this advice before. Just call all
day long from 9:00 to 5:00. It sounds
productive, doesn't it? Keeps you busy,
gives you a girl. Great. Except it
doesn't work because your prospects
aren't just sitting around waiting for
your call. They're in meetings. They're
busy. They're ignoring unknown numbers
because of course they are. So you spend
hours calling and barely got anyone to
pick up. Want more people to answer?
Then call smart, not non-stop. It's this
whole work smarter not harder thing.
Here's what Teddy Smith, senior account
executive at shared on our webinar. Call
before the workday starts or after it
winds down. That's when people are more
likely to actually pick up. Data backs
it up to best days, Wednesdays and
Thursdays. Worst day, unsurprisingly,
Friday, because everyone's already
thinking about the weekend. As for time
slots, try 10 to 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 to
5:00 p.m. But don't stop there. Test
what works best for your industry, your
audience, and your schedule, and go from
there. Call when it counts. Get replies
instead of voicemails. Tip number five,
adapt your tone to the person you're
calling. Ever answer the phone and
instantly know it's a salesperson. You
hear the tone, script, the fake
excitement, and boom, your guard goes
up. That's exactly how your prospects
feel. You sound canned or robotic.
They're out. Too enthusiastic, they shut
down. Too monotone, they don't trust
you. It's all a question of balance.
Baby, your voice is your first
impression. And if it's off, the call
ends before it began. Instead, use a
tone that feels familiar. Sound like
someone they already know. Start calm,
clear, and confident. Not pushy, not
weak, just leading the conversation.
Then mirror their energy. If they're
upbeat, bring in more energy. If they're
annoyed, don't overcompensate. Match
their intensity, then slowly guide them
to a better state. And if they're
pulling back, pull back a little, too.
Stay cool. Let them come to you. So,
start neutral, then adjust. This isn't
about acting, it's about connecting.
Tone, sets the pace. So, make it work
for you. Tip number six, use the WW
method and make a pitch that resonates.
So, you finally get a prospect on the
phone. Congratulations. Now, what if
your pitch feels random or vague?
They'll tune out in seconds. The worst
thing you can do is ramble or worse,
sound like every other rep out there.
You've got 30 seconds, maybe less, to
prove you're worth their time. And
remember, first impressions count.
That's where the WW method comes in. It
stands for why, what, and how. Simple
but deadly. It's effective. Start with
why. Why are you calling them? Make it
specific and relevant. Example, the
reason I'm reaching out is we work with
cast leaders in the name alliance.
followed with what. Lay out two to three
painful problems you solve. Keep it
concrete. Example, what I'm hearing is
that scope creep, chasing signatures and
forgotten renewals are cutting into
margins. Sometimes it's 20 to 30% of
engagements that go unbuild. Finally,
end with the how. Tell them how you fix
it and back it up. For example, with
Ignition, we automate proposals,
signatures, renewals, and payments.
Firms see over 50% time saved and in
some cases 80% less aged receivables.
Nice. If you've helped someone in the
same industry, drop that name. But keep
it relevant. A small firm won't care
about a Fortune 500 use case. Again,
relevancy matters in context. If you
don't have a name to drop, share
relatable numbers instead. This
structure keeps you sharp, clear, and
credible. WW, why, what, how? Use it and
watch your pitch land.
A few more. Starting with tip number
seven. Use a no-frame question for your
call to action. The call's going well.
You've nailed the pitch. Fantastic. Now
comes the moment that trips up most
reps. The ask. Want to book a meeting?
Do you have 30 minutes next week? These
yes questions sound simple, but they
create pressure. And pressure leads to
one thing, resistance. Put yourself in
their shoes. So instead, flip the
script. Use a no question that gives
your prospect control. Such as, "Would
it be crazy to schedule 20 minutes so I
can show you how we've helped firms like
yours?" This kind of ask feels safe. It
gives them an easy out and they don't
feel boxed in. And that drop in
pressure, it gets more honest answers
and more booked meetings. Bonus tip,
you're not selling your product on the
cold call. You're selling the meeting.
There's a difference. So talk more. It's
just enough. And leave them curious. No
frame your call to action. Make it
easier to say no and more likely they'll
say yes. Tip number eight, handle
objections with the AR framework. You're
about to land the meeting than it hits.
Just send me an email. Classic
objection. and you freeze, the call's
over. Most people either argue back or
give up. Both kill the deal. The key is
handling objections without breaking the
flow. Enter the ARRA framework.
Acknowledge. Respond. Ask. Here's how it
works. Acknowledge. Show them you hear
them. I totally get that. Makes sense.
Respond. Share insight that adds value.
Actually, that's why I called. An email
might raise more questions than it
answers. Ask. Use a no frame to move the
conversation forward. Would it be a bad
idea to take 15 minutes next week to
explore this? You're not pushing, you're
guiding. ARRA, AR helps you keep the
door open without sounding like a robot.
Objections aren't the end. They're just
detours. Use ARRA and steer the call
back on track. Last but not least, tip
number nine. Leave voicemails in
specific situations. Let's face it, most
calls go to voicemail. It's just a fact.
So, should you leave a message every
time? Not exactly. If you leave a
voicemail too early in your sequence,
you burn your chance. Too late and
you've already gone silent. Worse, if
your message is long or vague, it gets
ignored or straight up deleted. Here's
when you should leave a voicemail at the
very end of your call sequence when you
don't plan to call again anytime soon.
Now, two ways to do it right. Number
one, don't ask for a call back. Ask for
a reply. Hey, first name. We work with a
few similar companies. No need to call
me back. I'm literally just about to
send you an email. Just so we don't play
phone tag, mind replying if it's even
moderately interesting? It'll come from
Connor at lemist. Cheers. Short, casual,
specific. They get the points and you
might nudge them towards the email.
Number two, use curiosity. Let's say
you're calling Costco. Hey, this is
Jacob from Next to calling about Sam's
Club. Call me back when you get a
chance. No fluff, just enough to make
them curious enough for them to check
their inbox or return the call.
Voicemails aren't just about selling.
They're about sparking action. Leave
them when it counts. Say less, win more.
Yes, sometimes less literally is more.
